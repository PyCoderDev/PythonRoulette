# pyton roulet or sumting

haha buckshot roulette in python go brrrr
dis game is like russian roulette but with shotgun and health and items and stuff
dealer = the guy you play against
you = you (durhh)

## how play????

the current shell can be eiter live or it blank
if it live, whoever is shot lose 1 hp (you start at 4)
if it blank, whoever is shot lose no hp
if you shoot yourself with a blank, you skip dealer's turn
if dealer shoots *them*self, they will skip your turn.
when you run the code it will prompt you for input: type 1 to shoot yourself with the shotgun, type 2 to shoot the dealer, type 3 to use an item

## items n' stuff

at start of game you will have 2-4 items, and dealer will too

### item list and what they do

- handsaw: the shotgun will do double damage next shot
- magnifying glass: (best item in game) shows you the current round in the shotgun
- cigarette (THIS IS NOT HOW THEY WORK IN REAL LIFE!!!! source: the fda): gain 1 hp point (yes you can go past 4 with this)
- handcuffs: you cuff dealer, you skip their next turn. you can combine this with shooting yourself with a blank to have 3 turns in a row
- beer: removes the current shell from the shotgun, useful only on blank rounds
